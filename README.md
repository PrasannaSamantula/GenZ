# Understanding the Career Aspirations of Gen Z
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the career aspirations of Gen Z and identifying the gap between their expectations and what employers currently offer. The insights will help organizations attract, engage, and retain Gen Z talent by aligning work policies with their values and goals.

❓ Why This Project
There’s a fundamental disconnect between employers and Gen Z employees in terms of work expectations and work style. Gen Z prioritizes factors like flexibility, purpose-driven roles, and mental health support, while many employers still follow traditional policies.
This project aims to bridge this gap by understanding Gen Z’s expectations and providing actionable recommendations for employers.

🚩 Current Challenges
Gen Z Expectations: They value flexibility, diversity, growth opportunities, and meaningful work.

Employer Struggles: Companies find it difficult to attract, manage, and retain Gen Z employees because their existing policies don’t match Gen Z’s priorities.

Mismatch in Work Style: Gen Z’s preference for remote/hybrid work, mental health support, and continuous learning is not always available in traditional workplace setups.

🎯 Project Goals
